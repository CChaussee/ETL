Chelsea Chaussee, Cindy Jones, Lauren Toothaker, and Serena Baker representing "The Bones of Dreamers Past" will be analyzing two data sets from Recreation.gov https://ridb.recreation.gov/download and the American National Park Service(via Kaggle) https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity?select=species.csv in order to coordinate native plants located near hiking trails.

We will extract the csv formatted data files and join on park name, filter, and perform any additional cleaning as needed on the data to provide a final relational database.

We will then load our final database into an ORM and present a final project report.
